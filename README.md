HK2 and Spring interoperability and demos
=========================================

In the winter of 2013/2014 I was working in a shop where they were using Spring with Jersey and when
Jersey 2.0 was released it seemed as if the way that HK2 had been implemented in Jersey as the primary 
DI container had made a mess of the Jersey 1.X Spring integration. The issues were so bad that they
postponed upgrading to Jersey 2.X.

In the mean time I chaged jobs and became interested in CDI, and have been looking at some CDI
implementations, and I have done some experiments with DeltaSpike.

I decided that it might be a good time to try HK2,
