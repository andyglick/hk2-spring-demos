HK2 and Spring interoperability and demos
=========================================

In the winter of 2013/2014 I was working in a shop where they were using Spring with Jersey and when
the Jersey 2.0 was released it seemed as if the way that HK2 had been implemented to work with Spring 
that the Jersey developers involved had made a mess of the integration.

In the mean time I chaged jobs and became interesyed in CDI, and have been looking at some CDI
implementations, and I have done some experiments with DeltaSpike.o

I decided that it might be a good time to try HK2,
